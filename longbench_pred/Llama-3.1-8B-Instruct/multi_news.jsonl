In a surprising revelation, it has been reported that Kalashnikov expressed his deep regret and guilt over the numerous lives lost to his iconic rifle. In a lengthy emotional letter, Kalashnikov wrote to the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, expressing his deep spiritual pain and questioning his own moral responsibility for the deaths caused by his invention.\n\nThe letter, penned on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, is a poignant reflection of the designer's introspection and self-doubt. The letter highlights the complexities of Kalashnikov's legacy, a mix of pride and guilt, as he grapples with the consequences of his creation.\n\nInterestingly, Kalashnikov's legacy is a subject of ongoing debate. While he is celebrated for his innovative design, which has resulted in the sale of over 100 million rifles worldwide, he also grapples with the moral implications of his invention.

However, a new review of evidence by DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack has found that McCullough was wrongly convicted and that he had an alibi for the time of the murder. Schmack's review of evidence included newly discovered phone records that show McCullough made a collect call to his parents at 6:57 p.m. from a phone booth in downtown Rockford, which is 40 miles away from where Maria was abducted.\n\nThe review of evidence also included police reports and hundreds of other documents, including from the Air Force recruitment office, which Schmack said had been improperly barred at trial. Schmack also noted that Maria's friend had identified McCullough as the killer five decades later from an array of six photographs, but McCullough's picture stood out because everyone else wore suitcoats and their photos were professional yearbook pictures.\n\nSchmack's review of evidence found that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The study found that when women reported taking acetaminophen for 20 weeks or more, their children had a 50% increased risk of receiving ADHD medication. The study authors suggested that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development.\n\nHowever, the study's authors emphasized that the findings do not show a clear cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development. The study's authors also noted that the results do not show a cause-and-effect relationship and that more research is needed to understand the potential risks.\n\nExperts have also pointed out that the study's findings do not necessarily mean that acetaminophen should be avoided entirely during pregnancy. Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor and chair of the epidemiology department at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health, said that while the study's findings are concerning, they do not necessarily mean that acetaminophen should be avoided entirely during pregnancy.\n\nOther experts have also weighed in on the study's findings. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist and associate professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, noted that the study's findings do not necessarily mean that acetaminophen causes ADHD. He also pointed out that there are many variables that still need to be considered, such as the fact that ADHD runs in families.\n\nThe study's findings have also raised questions about the potential risks of acetaminophen during pregnancy.

President Barack Obama has vowed to veto any bill that includes changes to the ACA.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) has a powerful incentive to continue to press his party's fight against the ACA, as conservatives in the House Republican conference are clamoring for a confrontation over it.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) has taken the lead role in pushing a hardball Democratic legislative strategy that can be summed up like this: Make the Republicans cave. Democrats believe that the burden will be squarely on Boehner to pass a temporary stopgap measure to keep the government funded, or risk the wrath of voters tired of political brinksmanship.\n\nThe Washington region, home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors in the nation, could lose an estimated $200 million a day and see more than 700,000 jobs take a financial hit if the federal government shuts down on Monday night.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts.

Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged.

The child was undergoing a root canal procedure at Island Dentistry for Children in Kailua, where she suffered a heart attack and slipped into a coma. A month later, on January 3, 2014, the child succumbed to her injuries.\n\n**Cause of Death: Sedatives and Anesthesia**\n\nAccording to the autopsy report, the sedatives and anesthesia administered to the child prior to and during the procedure contributed to her death. The medical examiner's office concluded that the death was an accident. The child was given a combination of sedatives and anesthesia, including Demerol, hydroxyzine, and chlorohydrate, which likely led to her cardiac arrest.\n\n**Lack of Monitoring and CPR**\n\nThe child's family has filed a lawsuit against the dentist, Dr. Lilly Geyer, alleging negligence. The lawsuit claims that the child was not properly monitored during the procedure, and instead of checking her oxygen levels every five minutes, it was not done for 26 minutes. Furthermore, the lawsuit alleges that no one administered CPR to the child, and someone had to get a doctor from another office to do so.\n\n**Dentist's License and Background**\n\nDr. Geyer has been a licensed dentist in Hawaii since 2005.

The situation doesn't represent a life-threatening emergency, but it has required a cutback in normal operations on the orbiting outpost. The problem is one of the \"Big 14\" maintenance issues that NASA and its partners expect to face on an occasional basis during space station operations.\n\nThe issue began when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down when it reached a pre-set temperature limit on Wednesday. This forced NASA to reroute coolant into Loop-B, causing the station's six-person crew to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems were turned off in NASA's Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab.\n\nThe crew \"worked to keep the freezers going,\" said NASA spokesman Josh Byerly. Engineers think the problem was caused by a malfunctioning flow control valve for the station's ammonia coolant. Mission managers are trying to determine whether a software fix can get the valve working again, or whether a spacewalk will be required.\n\nSorting through all the issues might take a couple of days, or as much as a couple of weeks. Routine maintenance generally takes two weeks to plan for a \"Big 14\" repair operation, but that depends on the resources at hand and the urgency of the problem.\n\nIn the past, U.S. spacewalks were temporarily suspended after an Italian astronaut's spacesuit filled with water during a July outing. However, Russian spacewalks have proceeded without problems, and since July, NASA has made significant progress on resolving the spacesuit problem that Parmitano faced.\n\nThe space station's life support system is still up and running, and the current mission of the space station, officially called Expedition 38, is scheduled to go until March 2014.

According to the study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients is younger than 50, and by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in ten colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50. Researchers analyzed data from 258,000 patients with colorectal cancer and found that 37,847 of them, or about 15 percent, were diagnosed before age 50. These younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with more advanced cancer and were more likely to undergo surgery, with 72% of younger patients receiving surgery compared to 63% of older patients. Radiation therapy was also more likely to be used in younger patients, with 53% of younger patients receiving radiation therapy compared to 48% of older patients. Despite having more advanced cancer, younger patients lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence, with 68% of younger patients surviving five years compared to 67% of older patients. The study suggests that the current guidelines for screening should be revised to start at a younger age, with the researchers noting that the current guidelines may be catching patients late in the process of disease. However, it is unclear whether changing the screening guidelines would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths, with some experts suggesting that the current guidelines may be too early and the yield of screening would be very low.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev's 1962 model, which categorized civilizations into three types, has been updated to include a new, apocalyptic twist. According to the author, harvesting energy from distant stars is not just the best way to increase a civilization's available resources, but also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving that civilization alone in the vastness of space.\n\n**The Challenge of the Expanding Universe**\n\nThe study highlights the presence of dark energy in our universe, causing space to expand at an accelerating rate. Over the next 100 billion years, the stars beyond our Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making them inaccessible. This means that humans will have to rely on other methods to find intelligent life in the universe.\n\n**The Solution: Harnessing Star Energy**\n\nAccording to the study, advanced civilizations would understand the grim reality of universal expansion and would not just sit idly while the universe passes them by. Instead, they would capture stars from other galaxies, reel them in, and harvest their energy. This would be done by creating a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites, known as Dyson spheres, which would hover around a star, collecting its energy, and beaming it back to a nearby planet.\n\n**The Search for Alien Life**\n\nThe study proposes that advanced civilizations would be able to detect the presence of alien life by looking for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their useful stars harvested by an advanced civilization. These signatures would be detectable as a result of the propulsion that the stars are undergoing, which would require large amounts of energy and produce significant fluxes of electromagnetic radiation.\n\n**The Search for Alien Life: A New Perspective**\n\nThe study highlights the need for humans to develop new instruments to detect these unusual light signatures beaming from the depths of the universe. This would require the development of new technologies that can detect the presence of dark energy in the universe.\n\n**The Search for Alien Life: A New Perspective**\n\nThe study highlights the need for humans to develop new perspectives on the search for alien life.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The show was created by Jon Stewart and Craig Kilborn, and it was initially hosted by Craig Kilborn. However, in 1999, Jon Stewart took over as the host of the show, and it became a huge success. The show was known for its humorous take on current events, and it often poked fun at the conventions of traditional news programs.\n\nOne of the most notable moments in the show's history was when Jon Stewart interviewed Senator John McCain on the Straight Talk Express bus. During the interview, Steve Carell asked a question that was meant to be humorous, but it ended up being a bit too real. The question was about how McCain could reconcile his past support of pork-barrel politics with his current stance on the issue. McCain's response was to say that he was just kidding, and the whole exchange was a bit awkward.\n\nHowever, the interview was also a turning point for the show, as it marked a shift in the show's approach to politics. The show began to focus more on the behind-the-scenes aspects of politics, and less on the surface-level news. This was a result of the show's creators wanting to add a level of insight to the process that didn't exist.\n\nThe show's approach to politics was also influenced by the show's creators, who wanted to make fun of journalistic tropes.

{"pred": "Scientists have made groundbreaking discoveries in the field of archaeology, shedding new light on the evolution of human behavior and the emergence of modern humans. Recent studies have revealed that the Middle Stone Age, a period that occurred around 320,000 years ago, was characterized by the use of obsidian and the presence of prepared core technologies for making sophisticated points and blades. This period is marked by the absence of large cutting tools and the presence of prepared core technologies for making sophisticated points and blades.\n\nIn Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin, researchers have discovered evidence of the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the East African record. The discovery of bright red ochre pigment displaying evidence of grinding and cut marks is among the oldest known pigments used to color rocks in the archaeological record.\n\nStudies have also shown that the evolution of human behavior was influenced by climate change, with the area experiencing long-term, global environmental and climatic change. Around 800,000 years ago, the Olorgesailie Basin comprised a series of floodplains, which developed into a vast arid grassland with massive turnover of prey mammal species. This would have made life difficult for early humans in the region by making food sources unpredictable.\n\nThe crux of the papers is that hominin populations did not disappear, so at least some of them must have adapted technologically and culturally, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering, and sharing, and innovation. Excavations at five sites dating from 320,000 years ago revealed distinct differences in the forms of stone tools compared to older deposits in the area, suggesting technological innovation had taken place.\n\nThe researchers found that the next technological revolution, marking the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, occurred tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought. The team was digging in a region called Olorgesailie in southern Kenya, an area filled with layers of sediment dating back 1.2 million years. The oldest stone tools discovered there are characteristic of what's called the Acheulian culture of the Early Stone Age and consisted mostly of hand axes.\n\nIn addition to branch- and carcass-chopping, the axes were likely used to dig for water to drink or tubers to eat. The carcasses probably belonged to large animals like the giant (now extinct) ancestors of hippos. There's that same kind of exchange today, says Brooks, referring to hunter-gatherer groups like the Hadza people of northern Tanzania.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Israel had offered to hold its offensive to accommodate a visit from Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, provided Hamas held its fire as well. But Hamas said it would keep firing, and one Israeli defense minister complained that 50 rockets had flown in from Gaza during Kandil's visit, CNN reports.

Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times. Israel has now hit 250 Gaza targets, while taking further steps toward a ground invasion, calling up 16,000 reservists, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Borch, who was running on a familiar trail, noticed a raccoon obstructing her path and, upon closer inspection, realized it was acting strangely, baring its tiny teeth. The raccoon, which was later confirmed to be rabid, began to charge at Borch, and she quickly realized it was a threat to her safety.\n\nIn a split second, Borch decided to defend herself by using her bare hands to hold down the raccoon. The animal sank its teeth into Borch's thumb, and she was left with a puncture wound. Borch, who was in a state of panic, quickly realized that the raccoon was not going to let go of her thumb and decided to use a nearby puddle of water to her advantage. She pushed the raccoon's head underwater and held it there for what seemed like an eternity, until the animal stopped struggling and its arms fell to the side.\n\nBorch, who was hyperventilating and in hysterics, managed to pull her thumb out of the raccoon's mouth and then quickly bolted as fast as she could through the underbrush. She ran the three-quarters of a mile home to her house, where she met her mother, Elizabeth, and together they drove to Pen Bay Medical Center. Borch's father, who was at home, retrieved the dead raccoon and handed it over to the Maine Warden Service.\n\nThe dead raccoon was later confirmed to be positive for rabies by the Maine Center for Disease Control. According to the Maine CDC, if one animal tests positive for rabies, it's almost 100 percent certain that there are other animals in the area also infected. The Maine CDC also stated that an animal doesn't have to be aggressive to be infected; it can also act delirious or drunk-like.\n\nBorch has received six shots so far, including the rabies vaccine, and immunoglobulin and tetanus injections. She is slated to receive her last injection this weekend. Borch's advice for others who find themselves facing a rabid animal is that she has none.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to birds, rather than the loud roars often depicted in movies. Researchers found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are made by birds when they are in a territorial or courtship display, are more common in birds with larger body sizes. This discovery was made by a team of researchers from the University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University in Arizona, and the University of Utah, who studied the distribution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and other reptilian groups. The researchers found that 52 out of 208 bird species use closed-mouth vocalization, and that this behavior has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, and may have been present in some non-avian dinosaurs. The study's first author, Tobias Riede, said that the association with large bodies is a matter of physics, and that the inflation of an elastic cavity could present a size-dependent challenge. The researchers also found that closed-mouth vocalization can emerge in diverse archosaur species, and that it can be incorporated into mating displays. The study's co-author, Julia Clarke, said that the study offers clues about what non-avian dinosaurs sounded like, and that understanding how living birds vocalize is key to making sense of what non-avian dinosaurs sounded like. The researchers also found that closed-mouth vocalization can emerge in diverse archosaur species, and that it can be incorporated into mating displays. The study's co-author, Chad Eliason, said that looking at the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds that are alive today could tell us how dinosaurs vocalized.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time. They changed their findings, and presto, the plane was found.

Much of it will be some of the same adjectives used when any great performer dies—especially before their time. But in Williams' case, most of it will be true.\" Early in his career, \"it was clear that Mr. Williams was one of the most explosively, exhaustingly, prodigiously verbal comedians who ever lived,\" AO Scott writes in the New York Times. And beyond that, \"his essential persona as an entertainer combined neediness and generosity, intelligence and kindness, in ways that were charming and often unexpectedly moving.\" Williams may have gotten his start long before Aladdin, but he gave a \"generous and humble\" gift to the millennial generation, writes Daniel D'Addario at Salon. \"Williams will be remembered for his edgy comedy and for dramatic turns, but for people my age, Williams was our childhood,\" from Mrs. Doubtfire to Jumanji to Flubber. In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan recalls a moment when, facing an onslaught of photographers, Williams asked him—in the voice of a fly from a 1950s sci-fi flick—to \"help me, Ken.

The first supermoon of the year appeared on December 3, 2017, and will reappear as a visible supermoon on New Year's Day 2018 and again on January 31, 2018. This supermoon will be followed by a Blue Moon, a rare event that occurs when there are two full moons in a single month.\n\nThe Blue Moon on January 31, 2018, will be a total lunar eclipse, also known as a Super Blue Moon. This event is a rare occurrence, as the last time a Blue Moon occurred was in 1866. The next Blue Moon will occur on December 31, 2028, and the following year, on January 31, 2037. The Blue Moon on January 31, 2018, will be the first total eclipse of a Blue Moon in nearly 152 years.\n\nThe Super Blue Moon on January 31, 2018, will also feature a total lunar eclipse, with totality visible from eastern Asia to western North America. During the eclipse, the moon will slowly lose its brightness and take on a reddish hue due to the way the atmosphere bends the light. This phenomenon is known as a \"blood moon.\"\n\n**When to See the Supermoon and Blue Moon**\n\nThe best time to see the supermoon is right after moonrise and before sunrise, when the moon is sitting on the horizon. It will appear its biggest and brightest due to a \"moon illusion\" effect created when comparing the lunar body to other objects for scale, like buildings and foliage. Check your local moonrise time here.\n\n**Watching the Supermoon and Blue Moon**\n\nIf you miss the moonrise, you can still enjoy a larger-than-average moon for a few more days. On the night of January 31, the lunar eclipse will begin at 11:48 am UTC and reach its maximum at 1:30 pm UTC.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night.
