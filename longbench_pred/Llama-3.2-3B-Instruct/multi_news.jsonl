The research, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, reveals that cigarette smoke can make MRSA more resistant to the immune system's defenses.\n\nThe study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. Additionally, the smoke-exposed MRSA became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. Furthermore, the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. The study also revealed that the smoke-exposed MRSA became better at invading human cells in lab cultures.\n\nThe researchers discovered that cigarette smoke functions like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. This enhanced the bacteria's ability to adhere to human cells, making it more successful in its invasion. The study also found that the increased resistance to antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species continued for 24 hours after exposure.\n\nThe findings suggest that cigarette smoke can make MRSA more resistant to the immune system's defenses, making it harder to treat. This is a significant concern, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections, particularly in hospitals and other healthcare settings.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Crotty Alexander, stated that \"Cigarette smokers are known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases.

Samsung's smart TVs, for example, have been accused of allowing the company and its partners to listen in on everything users say, due to a new privacy policy. The policy states that the company and its partners can capture and transmit data on what users say, including personal or sensitive information, when users use voice recognition software. However, the policy also notes that the tool can be turned off through settings, which will stop the voice recognition feature from working entirely, but will still allow the company to collect data on how users use the TV.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung's SmartTV service offers a range of features that provide enhanced video content, customized TV, movie, and other content recommendations, as well as the ability to control and interact with the TV using gestures and voice commands. The service collects, uses, shares, and stores information about users' TV usage, and provides personalized content recommendations based on users' viewing history and other data. However, users can disable personalized recommendations and still have the TV collect information about their usage.\n\nIn contrast, Microsoft's new Xbox console has been criticized for its always-on listening mode, which will always listen to users even when the console is turned off. The new Kinect, a motion-sensing and listening peripheral, will be included with every Xbox One console and will be used for voice commands, gesture controls, and facial recognition. The system will be able to read users' heartbeats and recognize individual voices, but Microsoft claims that the system will only collect data on users' interactions and not on personal data.\n\nThese developments have raised concerns about the potential for companies to collect and use user data without their consent, and have sparked comparisons to George Orwell's classic novel 1984.", "answers": ["Own a Samsung smart TV?

According to a report by Lumos, a charity organization, 8 million children are currently separated from their families, often due to poverty, disability, or discrimination.\n\nThe issue was first brought to light by a powerful image in a newspaper, which sparked a chain of events leading to the establishment of Lumos. The organization, founded by a writer, has been working to shed light on the lives of these children, who are often subjected to atrocious conditions.\n\nResearch has shown that institutionalization causes measurable and sometimes irreparable harm to children. The effects of being separated from their families can be profound, leading to stunting, developmental delays, and psychological trauma. Furthermore, damage is done very early, and it is lasting.\n\nHowever, there is hope for change. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050. The solution lies in investing in inclusive education and health, where vulnerable families receive support for poverty, employment, and social and medical problems. Additionally, fostering, adoption, or other family-based care alternatives for children who cannot be with their parents are crucial.\n\nInternational donors play a vital role in this regard. The issues they choose to fund and the principles they promote greatly influence what support is available to children and families. Ending the practice of keeping children in institutions makes excellent economic sense, as it is far more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution.\n\nRecent successes in countries such as Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria demonstrate the potential for change.

New admissions to institutions in Bulgaria have also decreased, with a 54% reduction.\n\nA critical mass of expertise and evidence on the issue has been established, and a social media campaign has been launched to raise awareness and create change.

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The fossil of a small, bird-like dinosaur, named Caihong juji, has revealed iridescent feathers that shimmered with colors of the rainbow. The 160-million-year-old dinosaur, which lived during the Jurassic Period, had feathers that may have been used for display purposes, similar to those of modern hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery, published in the journal Nature Communications, has sparked excitement among scientists and researchers. The study, led by paleontologists from the University of Texas at Austin and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has provided new insights into the evolution of birds and dinosaurs.\n\nCaihong, which means \"rainbow with a big crest,\" was a carnivore that weighed roughly a pound. It had a bird-like body, including the sorts of feathers required for flight, but it had a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor. The dinosaur lived in forests and may have glided from tree to tree, preying on small mammals and lizards.\n\nThe team found that the dinosaur's feathers had microscopic structures called melanosomes, which determined the color.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The find, made by archaeologists from La Trobe University, has significant implications for the understanding of human settlement in Australia.\n\nThe Warratyi rock-shelter, located in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 km north of Adelaide, has yielded a wealth of artefacts, including burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre, and gypsum pigments, which are believed to be some of the oldest human tools ever found in Australia. The discovery, led by archaeologist Giles Hamm, has been dated to as far back as 49,000 years ago, pushing back the timeline of human presence in Australia by thousands of years.\n\nThe findings, published in the journal Nature, have sparked debate among archaeologists and challenge certain assumptions about the ingenuity of Indigenous Australians. The discovery of bones from an extinct giant wombat-like species, Diprotodon optatum, and eggs from an ancient giant bird, suggest that early humans were interacting with Australia's megafauna, including emus and a large, extinct flightless bird from the Genyornis genus.\n\nThe discovery, which has been hailed as a significant milestone in the debate over human extinction, has been welcomed by Indigenous Australians, who see the find as a major rewrite of the story of their people's history. The Adnyamathanha people, who worked on the property where the Warratyi rock-shelter is located, have expressed pride and happiness over the discovery, which they believe will help to rewrite the story of their people's history.\n\nThe discovery, which has been dated using a combination of estimates, including quartz grains and radiocarbon dating of burnt eggshells, suggests that early humans were actually living in close quarters to the megafauna, which challenges the Eurocentric view that material culture in Australia is quite simplistic and backward.\n\nThe find, which has been hailed as a significant finding, has sparked debate among archaeologists and challenges certain assumptions about the ingenuity of Indigenous Australians.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

The study, led by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, proposes that advanced civilizations must harvest energy from distant stars to prevent them from becoming inaccessible. This model suggests that civilizations must expand throughout the universe to secure as many stars as possible before they become permanently inaccessible.\n\nAccording to Hooper, the presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate, making it impossible for us to retrieve information from stars beyond our Local Group. As a result, if we hope to meet aliens in distant galaxies, it will be a race against dark energy, that mysterious force stretching our universe farther and farther apart.\n\nTo counter this, Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations would use a \"Dyson sphere\" - a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites - to capture and harness the energy of stars. This may seem like a tall order for humans, who are still bumbling around Level I of Kardashev's scale. However, some scientists think that there could be alien civilizations thousands or even millions of years older than ours who are already well into their Level III, star-harvesting phase.\n\nIn other words, if humans hope to meet aliens in distant galaxies, it'll be a race against dark energy, that mysterious force thought to be uncontrollably stretching our universe farther and farther apart.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The law also permits the use of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe new law paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical marijuana and industrial hemp, and will allow tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad to apply for permits to legally buy small amounts of \"ganja\" locally.

However, the law does not mean that Jamaica plans to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. The security forces will continue to rigorously enforce Jamaican law consistent with international treaty obligations.\n\nThe law is part of an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana, and last year Colorado and Washington legalized personal use. On Tuesday, Alaska became the third US state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana for adults.\n\nThe law also marks a significant victory for Rastafarians, who have long used marijuana for sacramental purposes.

Using advanced telescopes, they mapped the Martian atmosphere and found that the planet's water was once enough to cover the entire surface, creating a global ocean that could have supported life. The team calculated that the ocean would have been at least 137 meters deep, and possibly as deep as 450 feet in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThis finding challenges the previous understanding of Mars' water history, which suggested that the planet was always dry and cold. The scientists used the deuterium ratio to infer the amount of water on Mars, and found that the planet's water was once enough to create a massive ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe team's research, published in the journal Science, used advanced infrared telescopes to study the Martian atmosphere and found that the planet's water contained a representative deuterium value enriched by a factor of about 7 relative to Earth's ocean. The maps showed that the water ice in the polar reservoirs was enriched in deuterium to at least 8 VSMOW, which would mean that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep.\n\nThe discovery was made possible by studying the Martian atmosphere and its water molecules, which contain standard water molecules and deuterium. The team found that the concentration of deuterium in water left behind on Mars indicates that the planet lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps.\n\nThe researchers used the Keck II telescope and NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, both in Hawaii, and the ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile, to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They looked specifically at how different forms of water molecules in the Martian air varied from place to place over the changing seasons.\n\nThe team's research suggests that Mars was once a warm and wet world, with a massive ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The research, led by the University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University in Arizona, and the University of Newfoundland, analyzed the vocalizations of birds and other reptilian groups to understand the evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations.\n\nThe study found that 52 out of 208 investigated bird species use closed-mouth vocalizations, which are often quieter and lower in pitch compared to open-mouth vocalizations. The researchers identified that closed-mouth vocalizations are rare in small-bodied passerines and likely evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, including birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe findings suggest that some dinosaurs, particularly those with large body sizes, may have made closed-mouthed vocalizations, similar to those of modern birds. However, no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like. The study's authors propose that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays and co-occurred with open-mouthed vocalizations.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of understanding the evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and other reptilian groups. The study's authors suggest that the inflation of an elastic cavity could present a size-dependent challenge, which may have influenced the development of closed-mouth vocalizations in large-bodied dinosaurs.\n\nThe study's results offer clues about the sounds that extinct early avian species and perhaps their dinosaur ancestors produced. Future research will integrate information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to understand the sounds that extinct early avian species and perhaps their dinosaur ancestors produced.\n\nIn related news, a recent study published in The Washington Post found that the iconic T. rex's roar has been a subject of debate, with new research suggesting that dinosaurs may not have sounded like the classic Hollywood depiction. The study, led by the University of Texas, analyzed the fossil record and found that the sounds of dinosaurs were likely to be similar to those of modern birds, with some exceptions.\n\nIn another development, a sound designer, Gary Rydstrom, shared his experience of creating the iconic sounds of the movie \"Jurassic Park\" in an interview with Vulture.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

Two separate studies, conducted by Dr. Shinji Nishimoto and Professor Jack Gallant, have pushed the boundaries of what is possible in brain-computer interfaces and visual reconstruction.\n\nThe first study, led by Dr. Nishimoto, involved a team of researchers who used functional MRI scans to record brain activity while subjects watched YouTube videos. The team then created a computer model that matched brain activity to video features, resulting in a continuous, albeit abstract, reconstruction of the video as seen by the mind's eye. This achievement marks a major leap toward reconstructing internal imagery and may one day offer a glimpse into our dreams, memories, and fantasies.\n\nThe second study, conducted by Professor Gallant, utilized a similar approach, using brain imaging data to reconstruct YouTube videos from viewers' brain activity. The results, while blurry, provided a haunting, dream-like version of the video as seen by the mind's eye. This technology has the potential to decode movies people saw, which could lead to a deeper understanding of the brain's content, including dreams and thoughts.\n\nWhile these breakthroughs hold great promise, they also raise important questions about the nature of memories and the potential for future applications. The technology could one day be used to broadcast imagery, the scenes that play out inside our minds, independent of vision. This could have significant implications for individuals with paralysis, allowing them to control their environment through imagination sequences.\n\nHowever, the technology's limitations and potential applications are still being explored. The brain's complexity, consisting of dozens of modules, each processing different visual information, must be understood to build models for every part of the visual system. The study's findings also highlight the need for more data analysis and models to improve resolution and accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, these studies represent significant strides in understanding the human brain and visual perception, opening doors to new possibilities in brain-computer interfaces and visual reconstruction.

The plane's disappearance has been one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history, with no signs of wreckage or bodies ever found. Despite extensive searches, the cause of the disappearance and the location of the plane remain unknown.\n\nHowever, a team of statisticians from Metron Inc. in the US, led by Colleen M. Keller, used Bayesian statistics to help refine and focus the hunt for the plane. The team applied a rigorous framework to expert subjective judgment, quantifying subjective judgment and updating probabilities based on new information.\n\nBayesian statistics, named after Thomas Bayes, a British Presbyterian minister and mathematician, allow for the assessment of various scenarios at once, even contradictory ones. The team split the search area into a grid and applied to each cell a figure representing the probability that the plane would be found there.\n\nThe team assessed historical data from previous crashes, noting that planes were usually found very close to where they were last known to have been. They then lowered the probability of the plane being found in locations that had already been searched.\n\nThe approach is unique in that it allows for the consideration of all the data you have, including the uncertainties, and the combination of views that contradict each other. The second benefit of the Bayesian approach is that it is very flexible, allowing for the update of the body of knowledge at any time.\n\nThe team applied Bayes' Theorem, which allows for the assessment of various scenarios at once, even contradictory ones. The probability of each being true is brought together to give the most likely solution. If new information is obtained, the model can be revised easily.\n\nThe team found the plane in the Indian Ocean, but it was not in a location that had been searched. The investigation revealed that the plane had crashed due to pilot error in response to autopilot mode disengaging.\n\nThe team's approach has informed water searches for sunken treasure, men overboard, and plane-crash debris. The method has also been used in the hunt for the remnants of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people on board.\n\nThe team's success in solving the mystery of the Air France plane has been praised, with the chief scientist at Metron Inc. saying that the approach is valuable.

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?
