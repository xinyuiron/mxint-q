McCullough was freed shortly after the hearing and was whisked away in a car driven by a family member. The judge's ruling was prompted by a six-month review of evidence conducted by DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack, who concluded that McCullough could not have killed Maria. The precise time of Maria's abduction has been in dispute almost from the beginning. Maria's murder went unsolved for half a century.

Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM) is a mysterious, polio-like illness that has been experiencing a sudden surge in cases this year, with 32 confirmed cases reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of August. The condition, which primarily affects children, causes sudden limb weakness, and most patients have reported a respiratory or febrile illness preceding the onset of neurologic symptoms. The CDC is closely monitoring the trend and has sent out several health alerts to states to encourage them to communicate with doctors to report these cases in a timely fashion. The CDC began tracking AFM in 2014, when 121 cases were confirmed.\n\n2. A $3 billion scientific effort, led by Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, aims to rid the world of major diseases by the end of the century. The initiative, called the Biohub, is a collaborative effort between scientists, engineers, and researchers to develop new technologies and treatments for a range of diseases.\n\nIn addition to these main stories, there are also brief mentions of other health-related issues. For example, there is a story about a 3-year-old boy named Carter Roberts who came down with a mysterious disease called acute flaccid myelitis, which is a lot like polio. He lost control of his right arm, over his legs and other muscles within a few days. He has been diagnosed with the condition and has been experiencing partial paralysis, only being able to wiggle a toe and move the left side of his face.\n\nAnother story is about a family affected by AFM, the family of 5-year-old Braden Scott. He was struck with acute flaccid myelitis and it's a major improvement for someone with this polio-like illness.\n\nThere is also a story about a pediatric infectious disease specialist, Avindra Nath, who is concerned about the rising number of cases of AFM through July, as it could foretell a repeat of 2014.\n\nFinally, there is a story about a health official, Manisha Patel, who is the CDC official who leads the surveillance efforts for AFM.

Not much is known about the polio-like disease that plagues mostly children, including what causes it. What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing. About 200 kids have been diagnosed since 2014, and this year's figures are especially troubling. The CDC reports 121 cases of AFM were confirmed in 2014, but that was followed by just 21 cases in 2015, reports Fox News. From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully.

{"pred": "The Shroud of Turin, a cloth long revered by some as the burial cloth of Jesus, has been analyzed for inconsistent bloodstain patterns, suggesting it may be a medieval forgery. The Shroud, held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, bears an image of a crucified man and has been analyzed for decades. A new forensic investigation, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse. The inconsistencies in the bloodstains suggest that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. The researchers, Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, used real and synthetic blood samples on cloth to test the orientation of stains on the better-defined left side of the cloth. They hoped to answer a debate over whether the crucifixion depicted on the cloth was T-shaped, Y-shaped, or some other manner of ancient Roman execution. However, they found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. The researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric: the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back, along with a belt of blood (whether it is actually blood or paint pigments is another disputed forensic question). By pumping blood onto a model at wound points depicted on the shroud, they could compare the angle that gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud. They found that the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, for example, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees. A simulated spear wound in the chest ran in completely different patterns than the one on the shroud, whether standing or prone. \"This is just not what happens to a person on a cross,\" Borrini said.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports. As the researchers put it, the stains are \"totally unrealistic\" when compared to what they should look like. The shroud, which is held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Italy, is considered an icon, as opposed to a genuine religious relic, by the Vatican; Fox News notes \"the church has never weighed in on its authenticity.\" \"This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,\" the forensic scientist who conducted the analysis tells BuzzFeed News. \"Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.\" The study found inconsistent staining, with researchers concluding multiple poses were used to create the bloodstains—a standing model was likely used to imprint patterns on the cloth at various angles for various body parts. Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Since then, more than a dozen men, including five who were teens at the time, have come forward to allege that Spacey sexually harassed, assaulted, or attempted to rape them.\n\nOne of the accusers, Heather Unruh, a former news anchor, said that Spacey sexually assaulted her son in 2016 at a bar in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Her son was 18 at the time. She said that Spacey grabbed her son's genitals and her son told her that he was not of legal age to drink. Spacey bought him drink after drink after drink and when her son was drunk, Spacey made his move and sexually assaulted him.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Spacey will be completely cut from his upcoming film, All the Money in the World. Instead, Christopher Plummer will be brought in to reshoot the role of J.

{"pred": "In Seattle, a new tax of 1.75 cents per ounce was imposed on sweetened beverages, including soda, sports drinks, and kombucha, in an attempt to reduce sugar consumption, generate revenue for city projects, and subsidize healthy food purchases for low-income families. However, the tax has faced significant opposition, with critics arguing that it does not make people healthier, does not raise revenue but drives it outside city limits, and exacerbates inequality by making the poor poorer. The tax has also been criticized for being regressive and job-killing. The tax has led to a significant increase in the price of soda, with a case of Gatorade that cost $15.99 on December 31, 2017 now costing $26.33, an increase of more than 64 percent. Retailers like Costco have posted signs directing customers to locations outside city limits where shoppers can buy the product without the massive tax. The same thing happened to Philadelphia when it implemented a soda tax. The tax does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages. The west coast is often ground zero for politicians who pride themselves on social engineering. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University revealed that three of the top five states with the most paternalistic laws are California, Oregon, and Washington. The people of the city need to speak up and end this nightmare.\n\nIn another news, Seattle's sugary drink tax has led to a significant price increase for customers at Costco. A $15.99 case of Gatorade now costs an additional $10.34 due to the tax. A sign alerts Costco customers to the price change and also lets them know that they can go to the company’s Tukwila or Shoreline stores to buy the product without the added charge. The tax went into affect on January 1, 2018 and tacks on 1.75 cents per ounce.\n\nIn Cook County, the repeal of the penny-per-ounce tax on sugar and artificially sweetened beverages was passed last year within two months after a tremendous public outcry. The repeal of the tax likely will cost Daniel Stein, owner of Northbrook", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Senate Democrats have stated they will reject any changes to the health law, and President Barack Obama would veto such a bill. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) is pushing for the fight against the health law due to pressure from conservative members of the House Republican conference. If the House accepts a spending bill with no major changes to the health law, Republicans will likely wait until the last minute to act.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The Kenya Wildlife Service stated that the lion escaped from the Nairobi National Park on Wednesday and ended up in Isinya town, 12 miles away. Veterinary teams headed to Isinya after they got word on Mohawk's whereabouts. However, noise and commotion from bystanders agitated the animal, prompting it to attack the man.

On the day before the hurricane made landfall, Ricks wrote a detailed and dire forecast, warning of the unprecedented strength of the storm and the potential destruction it would cause. This forecast, titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE,\" was widely circulated and predicted the widespread devastation that would occur, including the failure of many homes and the loss of many lives.\n\nThe second article provides additional context for the situation in New Orleans on the day before the hurricane made landfall. Evacuations were underway, and people were arriving at the Superdome. At his desk at the National Weather Service office in Slidell, Ricks knew he had a job to do and felt he had one last chance to warn the public of the approaching danger. Ricks wrote the forecast, going through each point carefully and finding it difficult to take any out as they all seemed valid for the situation.\n\nThe forecast was accurate, and the hurricane caused widespread destruction, particularly in the Lower Ninth Ward section of New Orleans, where Ricks grew up. The article notes that Ricks and his fellow forecasters rode out the storm, and a rosary from Ricks's grandmother was kept with the forecast in the Smithsonian Museum of American History.\n\nIn a conference of broadcast meteorologists, Ricks spoke about the experience of issuing the forecast and the impact it had. He also discussed another, less widely circulated official forecast he issued that day, the Area Forecast Discussion, which warned \"Godspeed to all those in the path of this storm.\"\n\nThe articles also mention another meteorologist, Gary Szatkowski, who issued a \"personal plea\" during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which included statements like \"if you are still reluctant (to evacuate), think about your loved ones\" and earned him hero status.\n\nIn summary, the articles discuss the impact and forecasting of Hurricane Katrina, a devastating hurricane that struck Louisiana in 20", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day.

Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The tools have been dated to 44,000 years ago, but radiocarbon dating of burnt eggshells, which are thought to be evidence of human cooking, revealed them to be between 45,000 and 49,000 years old.

Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev introduced the concept of three types of technologically advanced civilizations in 1962, referred to as the three \"types\" of civilizations. These types, or levels, are referred to as Type I, II, and III, and represent the level of energy consumption of a civilization.\n\n2. A recent paper posted on the preprint journal arXiv.org has revived Kardashev's model and added a new, apocalyptic twist. According to the author, Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, harvesting energy from distant stars isn't just the best way to increase a civilization's available resources, but it's also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving that civilization totally alone in the vastness of space.\n\n3. Hooper explains that the presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate. Over the next approximately 100 billion years, the stars beyond our Local Group, or a group of gravitationally bound galaxies that includes the Milky Way, will fall beyond the cosmic horizon, meaning an observer here could never retrieve information from them over the course of the age of the universe.\n\n4.

Scientists and science-fiction authors have pondered this question for decades, and their favored answer is this: Throw a giant net around it, of course. This colossal cloud of harvesters could permanently hover around a star, beaming energy back to a nearby planet.\n\n7.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "In the field of archaeology, significant discoveries have been made in recent years regarding the evolution of human behavior and technology.\n\n1. A study published in Science reveals that dramatic shifts in East African climate may have driven toolmaking advances and the development of trading networks among early humans or their close relatives by the Middle Stone Age, approximately 320,000 years ago. This discovery was made through the examination of newly excavated Middle Stone Age tools and red pigment chunks from southern Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin. The tools and pigment were part of a long trend of climate-driven behavior changes in members of the Homo genus, which amped up in H. sapiens. The use of obsidian for the Middle Stone Age tools came from far away, raising the likelihood of long-distance contacts and trading among hominid populations near humankind's root.\n\n2. A separate study published in Science suggests that the \"human revolution\" 40,000-50,000 years ago, during which modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art arose, may have been a gradual process rather than a sudden event. This is based on evidence from the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, which places the evolution of some of these behaviors much further back in time, around 300,000 years ago. The study highlights technological change at this time that likely occurred in response to the effects of long-term, global, environmental, and climatic change.\n\n3. Another study published in Science suggests that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern may not have been a single event, but rather a gradual process. The study, which was conducted in the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, found that one or more hominin populations adapted technologically and culturally in response to the environment, leading to greater mobility, information gathering and sharing, and innovation. The study suggests that this adaptation occurred around 800,000 years ago, when the Olorgesailie Basin was a series of floodplains that developed into a vast arid grassland with massive turnover of prey mammal species as a consequence.\n\n4. A study published in the journal Life Journal suggests that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern never was. The study, which was conducted in the Olorgesailie Basin", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

The surgery, led by consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from six of Kieran's ribs, shaping and carving it into frameworks for his ears, and then grafting the ears onto his head under pockets of skin. The ears were shaped based on an outline of Kieran's mother's ears as a \"family template.\"\n\nKieran, who lives in Bushey, Hertfordshire, had struggled at his first school because he looked different to the other children. He has since moved to a school with a deafness unit in every year group, which has helped boost his confidence.\n\nIn the second case, a boy, whose name was not provided, also underwent a similar procedure to create new ears from his ribs. The procedure was also led by a team of surgeons at a hospital, but the location and the child's name were not provided.\n\nBoth procedures were primarily cosmetic, but they were expected to improve the children's confidence and quality of life. The children were also expected to have follow-up operations in six months' time.\n\nResearchers at the University College London Institute for Child Health are also working on a project to perform ear reconstructions for children like Kieran by growing new ear frameworks and other skeletal structures from a child's own stem cells. They hope to be able to use stem cells from a child's own fat tissue to create a new ear, which would be less invasive than the current treatment.\n\nAbout 100 children a year in the UK are born without one or both ears, a condition known as microtia.

Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

However, he was found guilty in a subsequent civil suit and ordered to pay $33.5 million to the Brown and Goldman families in 1997.\n\nSimpson's football career was legendary, as he was a Heisman Trophy winner and a member of the University of Southern California football team. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985.\n\nSimpson's net worth was estimated to be $10.8 million when he and Nicole Brown Simpson divorced in 1992, which is equivalent to more than $19 million as of May 2017. Much of his earnings came from his 20-year service as a spokesperson for car rental company Hertz.\n\nSimpson's football career and acting highlights included playing Nordberg in \"The Naked Gun\" movie franchise and T.D. Parker in the television series \"1st and Ten: The Championship.\"\n\nSimpson's net worth has seemingly been tight since the Nicole Brown murder trial. Despite being acquitted in the criminal case, he was found guilty in a 2007 civil suit and ordered to pay $33.5 million to the Brown and Goldman families. As of 2014, the family has collected less than 1% of the judgment.\n\nSimpson also defaulted on the mortgage of his estate in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles and the property went into foreclosure. Simpson purchased the 6,200-square-foot mansion for $650,000 in 1977. The new owner paid $4 million for the house before demolishing it.\n\nIn anticipation", "answers": ["OJ Simpson's parole hearing in Nevada will be broadcast live at 1pm EDT Thursday and there's a strong chance that his path to freedom will be clear by the end of the afternoon. Nobody has registered to testify against the 70-year-old Simpson, who has been in prison for nine years on 12 convictions related to a Las Vegas robbery and will appear before the Nevada Parole Board via videolink, NPR reports. Thursday's hearing will cover four concurrent sentences for use of a deadly weapon and two consecutive sentences for assault with a deadly weapon, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Four board members will vote after the hearing and Simpson could be free by Oct. 1 if they are all in favor of parole. If Simpson is indeed released this fall—which appears almost certainly to be the decision—it will \"renew the rabid curiosity\" in the case and \"produce a spectacle unlike anything we’ve seen since he went behind bars,\" Nancy Armour at USA Today predicts. There has even been talk that Simpson might end up with a reality TV show, but Armour wants Simpson to avoid the spotlight unless he wants to return to the \"toxic mentality that landed him in prison in the first place.\" If the former NFL star does end up with a TV show, the money is likely to go to the families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, CBS News reports.

The Maserati sped off at a high rate of speed and the Range Rover followed. At a stoplight, gunshots were fired from the SUV, hitting the Maserati, which then crashed into a taxi cab, causing it to burst into flames. The taxi driver and passenger were killed at the scene, and the Maserati driver was pronounced dead at a hospital. A passenger in the Maserati was among the injured. The SUV fled the scene and is being sought by authorities. The incident is being investigated as a possible rolling gun battle.

They found that Mars has a higher proportion of deuterium, a heavier form of hydrogen, in its water compared to Earth. By estimating the escape rate that would have led to this imbalance, the team could calculate how much water there once was.\n\nThe results suggest that if the water had covered the entire planet evenly, it would have reached a depth of about 450 feet (137 meters). However, it probably would have formed an ocean in the northern hemisphere, which has a consistently lower altitude.\n\nThe evidence continues to mount that Mars was once far wetter and warmer than it is today, and the chemical environment was potentially more hospitable to life. This, along with increasing signs that the ancient chemical environment was suitable for biology, strengthens the notion that life might have once existed on Mars.\n\nAnother study found that an ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars, making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold. The ocean, which was a mile deep in places, covered more than the Atlantic Ocean and was more than the Arctic Ocean in size.\n\nThe evidence for the ancient ocean adds to an emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, with trickling water, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes. The view of the planet's ancient history radically re-writes what many scientists believed only a decade ago, as flowing water was widely considered to have been a more erratic presence on Mars, gushing forth only rarely, and never forming long-standing seas and oceans.\n\nThe findings suggest that Mars was once a warmer and wetter planet, with a greater potential for life to have existed.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

This decision could open the door to own-brand imitations at local supermarkets, and potentially end the trademark status of similar treats like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj.

The case has been a costly saga for both sides.\n\nIn another news, a long-running legal battle between global chocolate giants over the shape of KitKat finger wafers was sent back to the EU's trademark office on Wednesday after judges dismissed appeals by both companies.

The ruling by the Luxembourg court found that Nestle had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive but also dismissed an appeal by Mondelez against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016 that had found the EUIPO was wrong to reject the US firm’s complaint. The case has been followed closely by trademark lawyers, who see implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets.
